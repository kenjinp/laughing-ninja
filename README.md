Node Web App &amp; API for the creation and simulation of new natural languages

Languages are arbitrary and follow rules, so it stands to reason that we can create them procedurally.

The API is meant to provide a toolset for people to create artificial languages and apply natural language processes and simulations to create variation in the language, and is intended to help people who create worlds make full-fledged languages to populate their environment with, such as game designers. 

The webapp is intended to be like a space engine or sandbox to create languages and warp them through simulated language processes to better understand how languages work and to learn principles of classic linguistics.
